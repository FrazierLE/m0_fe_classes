# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
There was definitely some productive struggle, but I really enjoy what we have been learning. Some of the material is harder for me to grasp than other topics.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I would say my workflow is going well. I think I am doing well at focusing on prioritization.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
Next week? I think I am confused. I thought Mod 0 was done after our evals. We are going to be doing intense technical lessons and challenges for 6 hours/day next week?
